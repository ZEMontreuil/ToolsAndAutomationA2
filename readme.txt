# Assignment 2 Instructions #

1. Clone this repository to a local directory.
2. Create a new branch, called "name-adding-feature," and checkout that branch.
3. Add to the main.js script a method that adds your name (feel free to hard-code your name into the script) to the unordered list element on the page. Commit this change when you are satisfied that it works.
 
*** Wait until your instructor indicates that you should continue to step 4 ***

4. Merge your changes to the main branch. Handle any conflicts so that your script still works properly.
5. Commit and push your merged changes.
5. Create a pull request for your new merge.
